# I'm learning lean

Probably check this out using the [lean web editor](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmodderme123%2Flean-graph%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fbasic.lean)

Or install lean with `brew install lean coreutils` and then run `leanpkg build` in this directory. 

I'm currently stuck at showing anything about different functions being equal.
